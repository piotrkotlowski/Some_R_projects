# Project: Health
This poster was created as part of the ***Data Visualization Techniques*** course and serves as the first obligatory project. For this assignment, we were tasked with collecting and exploring data in search of interesting correlations. We spent a significant amount of time analyzing various datasets (as evident from the number of CSV files).

Unfortunately, I lost all the R scripts used during the data exploration process. However, I was able to retain some of the charts generated along the way.
